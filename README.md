# Password Generator
Password Generator Project

## Description

The purpose of this Generate Password project was to teach bootcamp students how to use javascript to make a website function. Students had to write code in js including functions, if statements and for loops to ask the user what types of characters they would like used in the generated password. Those inputs from the user would then be used to generate a random password according to the users instructions.

## Usage

This website has one purpose, and that is to generate a random password given the input parameters from the user. After the user clicks on the "Generate Password" button, the window will then prompt them to answer a few questions. Those questions include, how long they want their password to be, and whether or not they want uppercase, lowercase, numeric and special characters to be included into their password. After all the windows pop-ups are answered, a random password will be generated based on how the previous questions were answered.
